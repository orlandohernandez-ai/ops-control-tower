# Ops Control Tower

Production-style data platform designed to simulate real-world logistics operations.

## Objective
Build an end-to-end architecture that ingests operational data, processes it through pipelines, and produces intelligence for monitoring delays, system health, and logistics risk.

## Architecture Vision
This project mirrors how modern enterprises design data platforms:

Data Sources → Ingestion → Storage → Processing → Analytics → Decision Layer

## Planned Stack
- Docker (containerized services)
- PostgreSQL (operational datastore)
- Python (data pipelines)
- Apache Airflow (workflow orchestration)
- dbt (data modeling)
- Power BI / Looker (analytics layer)

## Why This Project Matters
Logistics organizations live and die by operational visibility.

This Control Tower demonstrates how data architecture enables:

- Predictive delay detection  
- Operational awareness  
- Faster decision-making  
- Enterprise-scale data flow  

## Status
🚧 Building Architecture Foundation

End-to-end data platform designed to simulate real-world logistics operations, monitor system health, predict delays, and provide decision intelligence.

Built with production-style architecture using containers, pipelines, and analytics layers.
