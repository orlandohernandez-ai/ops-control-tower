# Ops Control Tower

Production-style end-to-end data platform designed to simulate real-world logistics operations, monitor system health, predict delays, and provide decision intelligence.

Built using modern data architecture principles with containers, pipelines, orchestration, and analytics layers.

---

## Status
🚧 Architecture Phase — Building the system foundation and defining core data flows.

---

## Objective

Design and implement an enterprise-style data platform that:

- Ingests operational data  
- Processes it through scalable pipelines  
- Detects risks and emerging delays  
- Provides real-time operational visibility  
- Supports faster, data-driven decisions  

This project mirrors how modern logistics organizations design intelligent operational systems.

---

## Architecture Vision

The platform follows a layered architecture:

**Data Sources → Ingestion → Storage → Processing → Analytics → Decision Layer**

Each layer is designed to reflect production-grade patterns used in real-world data engineering environments.

---

## Decision Layer (System Intelligence)

The Control Tower exists to make critical operational decisions easier and faster.

Key intelligence capabilities will include:

- Early detection of operational delays  
- Yard congestion visibility  
- Vehicle readiness monitoring  
- Maintenance risk identification  
- Workflow bottleneck detection  
- Dispatch prioritization support  
- System health awareness  

The goal is to shift operations from reactive → predictive.

## Planned Tech Stack

- **Docker** — containerized services  
- **PostgreSQL** — operational datastore  
- **Python** — data pipelines  
- **Apache Airflow** — workflow orchestration  
- **dbt** — data modeling & transformation  
- **Power BI / Looker** — analytics & visualization  

The stack reflects technologies commonly used in modern data platforms.

## Why This Project Matters

Logistics organizations live and die by operational visibility.

Without timely intelligence:

- Delays compound  
- Resources are misallocated  
- Bottlenecks go unnoticed  
- Decision-making slows  

This Control Tower demonstrates how data architecture enables:

- Predictive delay detection  
- Operational awareness  
- Faster decision-making  
- Enterprise-scale data flow  

---

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time streaming ingestion  
- Machine learning for delay prediction  
- Automated anomaly detection  
- Alerting framework  
- Digital twin simulation  
- Control dashboard

## Design Philosophy

This project is intentionally built using **production-style architecture**, even at the prototype stage.

The objective is not just to build a project…

…but to engineer a system that reflects how modern data platforms are designed.
